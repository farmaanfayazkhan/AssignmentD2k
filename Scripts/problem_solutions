Develop SQL queries to answer the following questions:
    1. What are the peak hours for taxi usage?
    2. How does passenger count affect the trip fare?
    3. What are the trends in usage over the year?
Create visualizations to represent the findings?


1. What are the peak hours for taxi usage?
#Sql query

SELECT strftime('%H', pickup_datetime) AS hour, COUNT(*) AS trip_count
FROM trips
GROUP BY hour
ORDER BY trip_count DESC;

#Visualisation
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

engine = create_engine('sqlite:///nyc_taxi.db')
query = """
SELECT strftime('%H', pickup_datetime) AS hour, COUNT(*) AS trip_count
FROM trips
GROUP BY hour
ORDER BY trip_count DESC;
"""
df = pd.read_sql(query, engine)
df.plot(kind='bar', x='hour', y='trip_count', title='Peak Hours for Taxi Usage')
plt.xlabel('Hour of Day')
plt.ylabel('Number of Trips')
plt.show()

2. How does passenger count affect the trip fare?

#sql query
SELECT passenger_count, AVG(fare_amount) AS avg_fare
FROM trips
GROUP BY passenger_count
ORDER BY passenger_count;

#visualisation
query = """
SELECT passenger_count, AVG(fare_amount) AS avg_fare
FROM trips
GROUP BY passenger_count
ORDER BY passenger_count;
"""
df = pd.read_sql(query, engine)
df.plot(kind='bar', x='passenger_count', y='avg_fare', title='Passenger Count vs. Trip Fare')
plt.xlabel('Passenger Count')
plt.ylabel('Average Fare ($)')
plt.show()

3.  Trends in Usage Over the Year

#sql query 
SELECT strftime('%m', pickup_datetime) AS month, COUNT(*) AS trip_count
FROM trips
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month;

#Visualisation
query = """
SELECT strftime('%m', pickup_datetime) AS month, COUNT(*) AS trip_count
FROM trips
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month;
"""
df = pd.read_sql(query, engine)
df['month'] = df['month'].astype(int)
df.plot(kind='line', x='month', y='trip_count', marker='o', title='Trends in Taxi Usage Over the Year')
plt.xlabel('Month')
plt.ylabel('Number of Trips')
plt.xticks(df['month'], ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec'])
plt.show()
